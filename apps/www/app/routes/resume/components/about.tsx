        I believe highly functioning software teams make the world better. I'm a builder — of
        software, of teams, of organizations. Developer, architect, leader, executive: I've
        succeeded at every level, and I remain hands-on because the best technical leaders never
        leave the keyboard. I strive to be a catalyst for the success of every person and project I
        touch.
